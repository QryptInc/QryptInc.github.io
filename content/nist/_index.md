## Using Qrypt's NIST Entropy Quality Tests

Qryptâ€™s NIST Entropy Quality Tests is a set of APIs that allows you to check the quality of Qrypt's entropy using standardized NIST tests. Tests are conducted every 10 minutes against Qrypt's Quantum Entropy service. Accessing this service does not require a Qrypt account or access token. 

---
## About NIST Entropy Quality Tests
The NIST Entropy Quality Test suite uses the standardized NIST STS suite, as well as uniformity tests. 

## NIST Entropy Quality Test Endpoints
There are three endpoints for obtaining NIST entropy quality test results. 
1. NIST Logs: retrieves a specified number of recent test results
2. Failing NIST Logs: retrieves a specified number of recent failing test results
3. Failing NIST Random: retrieves random of recent failing tests

### NIST Logs
This API contains the most recent NIST test results, including details on NIST STS tests and uniformity. To get NIST test results, you must submit an HTTP request to the API, optionally providing the number of results to view and whether they should be shown in a simplified format.

1. Make a request to the following URL: {{< externalLink link="https://nist.qrypt.com/api/v1/logs?num={num_logs}&simple={true_or_false}" text="https://nist.qrypt.com/api/v1/logs?num={num_logs}&simple={true_or_false}" >}}.
2. Optionally replace {**num_logs**} with the desired number of recent test results to show.
3. Optionally replace {**true_or_false**} with a true or false to specify if you want a simplified test result output.

##### Request Parameters
{{< nist/logs/requestParameters >}}

##### Response Codes
{{< nist/logs/responseCodes >}}

##### JSON Response Fields

For a successful 200 response, the response contains a JSON-encoded structure with an array of test results with the following fields in each array element. Note that the simplified logs only contain 'tests_passed', 'time_of_completion' and 'time_of_completion_string' fields. 

{{< nist/logs/jsonResponseFields >}}

The following illustrates an example of JSON output as returned by a request for a single log:

```
[
    {
        "nist_all_passed": true,
        "nist_fails": 86,
        "nist_passes": 8742,
        "nist_success_rate": 0.9855783640783642,
        "tests_passed": true,
        "time_of_completion": 1699551247.1653655,
        "time_of_completion_string": "11/09/2023 12:34",
        "uniformity_all_passed": true,
        "uniformity_fails": 0,
        "uniformity_passes": 15,
        "uniformity_success_rate": 1.0
    }
]
```

### NIST Failed Test Logs
This API contains the most recent failed NIST test results. To get failed NIST test results, you must submit an HTTP request to the API, optionally providing the number of results to view and whether they should be shown in a simplified format.

1. Make a request to the following URL: {{< externalLink link="https://nist.qrypt.com/api/v1/failing_logs?num={num}&simple={simple}&strict={strict}&include_random={include_random}&randsize={randsize}" text="https://nist.qrypt.com/api/v1/failing_logs?num={num}&simple={simple}&strict={strict}&include_random={include_random}&randsize={randsize}" >}}
2. Optionally replace {**num**} with the number of recent test results to show.
3. Optionally replace {**simple**} with 'true' to output simplified logs.
4. Optionally replace {**strict**} with 'true' specify if you want to show only strictly failing test results.
4. Optionally replace {**include_random**} with 'true' to see failed random. Only applicable if 'strict' is 'true'.
5. Optionally replace {**randsize**} with the number of bits to show. Only applicable if 'include_random' is set to 'true'.

##### Request Parameters
{{< nist/failing_logs/requestParameters >}}

##### Response Codes
{{< nist/failing_logs/responseCodes >}}

##### JSON Response Fields

The JSON response fields are identical to the NIST Logs API, except for the 'random' field. 

{{< nist/failing_logs/jsonResponseFields >}}

The following illustrates an example of JSON output as returned by a request for a single log:

```
[
    {
        "nist_all_passed": true,
        "nist_fails": 86,
        "nist_passes": 8742,
        "nist_success_rate": 0.9855783640783642,
        "tests_passed": true,
        "time_of_completion": 1699551247.1653655,
        "time_of_completion_string": "11/09/2023 12:34",
        "uniformity_all_passed": true,
        "uniformity_fails": 0,
        "uniformity_passes": 15,
        "uniformity_success_rate": 1.0,
        "random": "111110100110010100001010100011"
    }
]
```


### NIST Failed Random
This API contains the random of the most recent failed NIST tests. To get the random of failed NIST test results, you must submit an HTTP request to the API, optionally providing the number of results to view and whether they should be shown in a simplified format.

1. Make a request to the following URL: {{< externalLink link="https://nist.qrypt.com/api/v1/failing_random?num={num}&randsize={randsize}" text="https://nist.qrypt.com/api/v1/failing_random?num={num}&randsize={randsize}" >}}
2. Optionally replace {**num**} with the number of recent test results to show.
3. Optionally replace {**randsize**} with 'true' to output simplified logs.

##### Request Parameters
{{< nist/failing_random/requestParameters >}}

##### Response Codes
{{< nist/failing_random/responseCodes >}}

##### JSON Response Fields
