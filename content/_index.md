Our documentation is written by developers for developers. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for developers to use Qrypt to secure applications and infrastructure.

We believe that documentation benefits from sharing and collaborative improvement. Qrypt documentation is available on Github pages and we invite anybody to make changes or to create issues when there is content that needs to be improved.
## Integrating with Qrypt
Below is a list of the products that Qrypt offers with links to their supporting documentation.

### Entropy as a service - [Docs](/eaas/)

Qrypt Entropy as a Service (EaaS) measures quantum effects and converts those measurements into pure random numbers. EaaS leverages multiple Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) developed by national and international research labs to ensure the highest quality random.

### QDARA - Quantum data at rest algorithm - [Docs](/data_at_rest/)

Our quantum secure data-at-rest command line tool is powered by our patented BLAST algorithm, which leverages quantum random number generation from our Entropy as a Service to produce perfectly random one-time pads. Alice can quickly and easily encrypt sensitive files with quantum random generated one-time pads. Bob must have the same pad in order to decrypt the data to read the files, ensuring important information is kept secret.

### Qrypt Security - [Docs](sdk/)
Qrypt Security includes client library SDKs, cloud-based REST services, command line clients and guidance to help integrate post-quantum security into your applications and services. You can add security features to your applications without being an expert in post-quantum cryptography.
