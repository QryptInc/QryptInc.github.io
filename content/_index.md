## Entropy as a service

Qrypt EaaS uses devices that measure quantum effects and 
convert the measurements into pure random numbers – quantum 
random number generators (QRNG). Only Qrypt’s EaaS leverages 
multiple QRNGs developed through US and international research 
labs to ensure high quality randomness.

## Quantum secure cryptography

Our quantum secure data-at-rest product is powered by our 
patented BLAST algorithm, which leverages quantum random 
number generation from multiple sources of entropy to produce 
perfectly random one-time pad keys. Any user can quickly and 
easily encrypt sensitive files with quantum random generated 
one-time pads. Only users with the same pad can decrypt the data 
to read the files, ensuring important information is kept secret.
