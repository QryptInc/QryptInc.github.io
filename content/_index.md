Our documentation is written by developers for developers. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for developers to use Qrypt to secure applications and infrastructure.

We believe that documentation benefits from sharing and collaborative improvement. Qrypt documentation is available on Github pages and we invite anybody to make changes or to create issues when there is content that needs to be improved.
## Integrating with Qrypt
Below is a list of the products that Qrypt offers with links to their supporting documentation.

### Quantum Entropy - [Docs](/eaas/)

Qrypt's Quantum Entropy service measures quantum effects and converts those measurements into pure random numbers. The service leverages multiple Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) developed by national and international research labs to ensure the highest quality random.

### Key Generation - [Docs](sdk/)
Qrypt SDK includes client library SDKs, cloud-based REST services, command line clients and guidance to help integrate post-quantum security into your applications and services. You can add security features to your applications without being an expert in post-quantum cryptography.
