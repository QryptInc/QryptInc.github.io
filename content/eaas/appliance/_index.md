# Introduction

The Quantum Entropy Appliance (QEA) is a server that comes equipped with Qrypt’s quantum random number generator cards. These cards continuously measure quantum phenomena to generate streams of truly random bytes.

The QEA can be installed on-prem, or in a data center, and it does not require any external network access. It exposes a REST API that can be called by clients in the same network to request arbitrary amounts of true random bytes.

---
# How do we ensure true randomness?

The entropy generated by the QEA  is continuously tested using the [NIST SP800-22](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf) entropy source validation test suite. If any of the tests fail, then that entropy source is cut off until its output passes tests again.

The appliance also includes an extensive set of hardware health monitors that shut down the entropy source at the card level in the event of any hardware failure or anomaly.

---
# Performance

Due to the high overhead cost of making HTTP requests, the amount of entropy that can be retrieved from the API depends on how much entropy the client asks for with each request. In other words, it's significantly faster to make 1 request for 512 keys than it is to make 512 requests for 1 key.

**Max API throughput:**
| 256 bit keys per request| Requests per second
|---|---|
|512|~4,800|
|1|~8,000|

**Max Entropy card output:** ~1,500 Mb/s

---
# Installation

The QEA comes with Ubuntu Server v22.04 installed. Users will receive login credentials which they can use to perform any necessary admin tasks.

The QEA can be installed on-prem or in a datacenter rack. Once the appliance is connected to the network interface, the user must log in and configure its network interface (see the [Ubuntu docs](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/configuring-networks) for a detailed guide on how to set up networking on Ubuntu Server).

---
# Interacting with the appliance

The QEA listens for incoming requests on port 80.

The root path (“/”) returns a UI that displays various metrics, and health reports. This UI can also be used to download application log files for troubleshooting purposes.

Client applications can request a configurable amount of entropy from the entropy API, which is served from the “/api/v1/” route. The complete spec for the API can be found below.
