Encryption for data at rest requires trusted quantum random.

Qrypt provides the only future-proof solution, supported by an advanced pipeline of sources that can be combined to increase entropy.

- Keys can be generated based on trusted quantum - reducing the chance of a random-based attack.
- Client locally extracts keys  from returned random â€“ not even Qrypt can determine the keys.
- Supports* integration to standard key management solutions.
