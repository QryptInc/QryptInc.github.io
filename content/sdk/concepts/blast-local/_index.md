Certain use cases prefer local implementation.

Qrypt’s solution has the flexibility for local management.

- Keys can be generated based on trusted quantum - reducing the chance of a random-based attack
- Client locally extracts keys  from returned random – not even Qrypt can determine the keys
- Supports* integration to standard key management solutions
