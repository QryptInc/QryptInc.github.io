Encryption can only be provably secure when based on quantum random numbers​.

Qrypt offers entropy as a service, with expertly engineered quantum random number generators based on published techniques to ensure high quantum to classical signal extraction.

- Quality entropy starts with quantum, extracted with high quantum to classical signal - you can’t remove classical contribution after the fact​.
- Qrypt never treats sources as black boxes, we share our technology approach and solicit peer review to ensure a robust entropy source​.
- The service protects the quantum signal through proper quantum data stream management and never hashes data streams​.
- Qrypt maintains an advanced pipeline of future sources from respected research institutions including ORNL, LANL, and EPFL​.
