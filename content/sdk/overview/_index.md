### What is Qrypt Security?

Qrypt Security includes client library SDKs, cloud-based REST services, command line clients and guidance to help integrate post-quantum and everlasting security into your applications and services. You can add security features to your applications without being an expert in post-quantum cryptography. 

Specifically, we currently offer features for:

* post-quantum safe file encryption
* secure end-to-end messaging 
* one-time pads (late 4th Quarter, 2021)

Our Quantum Enhanced Classical product line brings value to you by giving you quantum random on your computers, encrypting files with better AES keys generated from quantum random, and better messaging that you're using now because the keys are created from quantum random. But our Everlasting Security product line gives you those things, as well as a seamless upgrade path to Post Quantum security and beyond, when you're ready.
