Businesses need to protect against the future quantum threat, and never distribute encryption keys that can be intercepted. The Qrypt SDK allows you to generate identical keys at multiple endpoints.

## [Overview](overview/)

Developers need familiar tools based on modern development practices. We provide an SDK that can be easily integrated into applications and infrastructure to make them quantum-secure.

The Qrypt SDK includes client library SDKs, cloud-based REST services, command line clients and guidance to help integrate post-quantum security into your applications and services. You can add security features to your applications without being an expert in post-quantum cryptography.

This service requires an access token. Follow the steps in {{< externalLink link="/sign_up" text="Getting Started" >}} to obtain an access token.
