Certain use cases prefer local implementation.

Qrypt’s solution has the flexibility for local management.

1. Keys can be generated based on trusted quantum - reducing the chance of a random-based attack.
2. Client locally extracts keys from returned random – not even Qrypt can determine the keys.
3. Supports integration to standard key management solutions.
