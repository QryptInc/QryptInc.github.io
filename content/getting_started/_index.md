## Generate an access token

To use Qrypt's Quantum Entropy or Key Generation, you need an access token.

1. Navigate to the Tokens page.
2. Assign a name to the token to help you distinguish between different tokens.
3. Select 'Entropy' and/or 'Keygen to specify which service you will be using the token for.
4. Select the expiration period. This determines when the token will expire and need to be replaced.
5. Click the **"Generate token"** button.
6. The generated token will be displayed. Copy the token using the “Copy” button and store it in a secure location. Important: This is the only time you will be able to view the access token. Be sure to copy and store it before closing this popup.
7. Save the access token to a secure location. Your access token is used to make requests for entropy, a budgeted resource. It should be treated as secure data, very much like a password.
